Q: How do you destructure an object with nested properties?

You can match the same structure inside curly braces when extracting values.

const user = {
  name: "Asha",
  address: {
    city: "Delhi",
    pin: 110001
  }
};

const { address: { city, pin } } = user;
console.log(city, pin);  // Delhi 110001
