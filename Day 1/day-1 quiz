  1. What is the difference between let and var?
   var
   var is function-scoped and can be redeclared in the same scope.
   It is hoisted and initialized with undefined.
   let
   let is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same block.
   It is hoisted but not initialized — accessing before declaration causes an error.

    int y = ++x;
    printf("%d %d", x, y);//output: 6 6
    return 0;
    }
